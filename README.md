# Stock-Market-Prediction-using-Numerical-and-Textual-Analysis

This Project is a part of The Sparks Foundation GRIP internship which is focussed on creating a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction
using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines.

Stock to analyze and predict SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)

Download historical stock prices from https://finance.yahoo.com/
Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6

I have used Long short-term memory (LSTM) , Convolutional 1D and Mixed Convolutional and long short-term memomry to make stock market prices predictions using the historical stock prices data. In the sentiment analysis model, different machine learning algorithms-Random Forest Regressor, Decision-Tree Regressor and Xgboost Regressor are used to make the predictions.
